            <div class="entry-content">
            <p>A new Quilt Draw release has been made!  To use it, go to its <a class="reference external" href="https://sapphirecat.github.io/quilt-draw/">repository
page</a>.  <em>Possible issue:</em> Please turn off Dark Reader for the site when using a
browser that supports prefers-color-scheme, because the site already has a dark
theme for that environment.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>major</strong> release that restructures the entire UI into tabs.  The
“Block” tab retains the editor, block controls, and a mini-preview.  A larger
preview, and controls for the quilt as a whole, are on the “Quilt” tab.
Finally, there is a “Print” tab with a print-oriented layout.  It should show
the block at a reasonable size, along with the whole preview, on a single page.</p>
<p>Printing is meant to work <em>reasonably well</em> on either A4 or US Letter paper
sizes with “fit width” as the scaling option.  Please file an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sapphirecat/quilt-draw/issues/">issue</a> if there
are any problems.</p>
<p>The tools for the block editor have been revamped to be graphical.</p>
<p>The “spin” and “flip” tools have been reworked, so that <strong>all operations are
available without a right-click</strong> function available.  That is, instead of a
single “Flip” tool that chooses directions based entirely on the mouse button,
there are distinct “↔” (horizontal flip) and “↕” (vertical flip) tools.  Each
one <em>supports</em> right-click to do the related operation, but it is no longer
<em>required.</em></p>
<p>Minor features include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The main/secondary color layout is vertical, to reduce confusion when using
left-handed mouse button layout (the primary color is now above, rather than
to the left of, the secondary color.)</li>
<li>The mouse cursor changes shape over the block editor, based on the currently
selected tool, as an additional hint.</li>
<li>New site/app icons have been created.</li>
</ul>
<p>This release has been tagged in the repository as <tt class="docutils literal">v2.0.0</tt>; going forward,
each release will be given a version number, according to the <a class="reference external" href="https://semver.org/">Semantic
Versioning</a> standard.</p>
<p>Support for Firefox 52 ESR (Windows XP/Vista) and Pale Moon has been retained.
I would like to give a special salute to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> for supporting operating
systems longer than <em>strictly</em> necessary.</p>

            <p>I am pleased to announce the first release of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sapphirecat/garden-vim">garden-vim</a>, a dark, earthy
theme primarily for GUI (gVim, neovim, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/termstandard/colors">truecolor terminals</a>.)</p>
<p>Screenshots, with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline">airline</a>:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://sapphirecat.github.io/images/garden/garden-php.png"><img alt="Garden theme with PHP code" src="https://sapphirecat.github.io/images/garden/garden-php.png" /></a></div>

</div>
<p>The airline theme is designed to change only the leftmost background when
changing modes.  Changing the entire line seemed rather distracting.</p>
<p>Due to the limitations of the 256-color XTerm palette, there exists a 256-color
theme, but it is not recommended.  One should use <tt class="docutils literal">:set termguicolors</tt>
to activate truecolor rendering in terminal windows for the best experience.
Alternatively, check <tt class="docutils literal">if <span class="pre">has('gui_running')</span></tt> to choose a different theme for
the terminal in the <tt class="docutils literal">else</tt> branch of your vimrc file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
if has('gui_running')
  colorscheme garden
else
  colorscheme desert
endif
</pre>
<p>Once again, the repository is github.com/sapphirecat/<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sapphirecat/garden-vim">garden-vim</a>.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>

            <div class="entry-content">
            <p>This is a small pre-announcement; nothing is available yet.</p>
<p>I have another update planned for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sapphirecat/zora-theme-vim">the Zora vim theme</a>, namely, support for
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline">airline</a>.</p>
<p>A previous update to Zora is that version 1.1.0 (renamed and) documented a
config option, the <tt class="docutils literal">g:zora_use_gui_colors</tt> variable.  Internally, the theme
loads <em>only</em> GUI colors if the GUI is running, the <tt class="docutils literal">termguicolors</tt> option is
known+set… or if the variable is set to 1.  Otherwise, it falls back to checking
<tt class="docutils literal">t_Co</tt> to load the 256- or 16-color theme, depending on the terminal’s
capabilities.</p>
<p>I am also designing a new theme called Garden, a GUI-oriented theme in warm
earthy tones with a dark green background.  This theme will have <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline">airline</a>
support from the start.  A <em>serviceable</em> 256-color variant will be provided,
but the background color will be gray instead of green.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the final release!</p>

<div class="section" id="why-am-i-doing-this">
<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p>In 2012, I bought a PC, and work bought a Late 2012 model iMac for my desk.
That iMac ended up coming home for the pandemic.  They finally replaced it with
a System76 laptop (at my request) in 2022, because we have a large investment in
VirtualBox and x86, and sometimes they want to fly me to other offices.  I
didn’t rate it as likely that the last Intel systems from Apple would get a full
decade of support, but that’s what I’m targeting for them.</p>
<p>As for my PC… I am writing this on it.  It’s still running.  It has had an SSD
upgrade, of course, because Windows Compatibility Telemetry was such a drag on
the hard disk, and it’s had an extra 4 GB of RAM put in (freed up by upgrading a
different system.)</p>
<p>It started life with Windows 7, just barely, then moved on through 8, 8.1, and
10.  It might live to see the end of support for Windows 10… and then Microsoft
thinks it should become e-waste, just like the iMac.</p>
<p>But they’re both perfectly functional machines!</p>
<p>What if I wanted to use hardware for 15 years?  20 years?  Could I make my own
code run on systems that old?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-does-it-work">
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>I discovered that Pickr had an ES5 build (well-supported in IE9+, and crucially,
Firefox 52), so I switched to that instead.  That allowed for the initial
Windows XP/Vista support.</p>
<p>Unreleased but fully tested, I have updated the toolchain for Quilt Draw itself.
It used to directly use the Typescript 3.9 compiler.  This has been replaced
with Webpack and the usual suspects.  The new build system supports Typescript
5.1, so now I can catch up on years of new features, and push more of the future
deeper into the past.</p>

            <p>Following the reporting (and subsequent fixing) of issue #1,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sapphirecat/slim4-http-interop-adapter</span></tt> has two new versions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>1.0.2 updates the <tt class="docutils literal">composer.json</tt> to reject Slim 4.11 and newer, while
retaining compatibility with PHP 7.1</li>
<li>1.1.0 requires Slim 4.11+ and PHP 7.4+</li>
</ul>
<p>Links: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sapphirecat/slim4-http-interop-adapter">GitHub</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://packagist.org/packages/sapphirecat/slim4-http-interop-adapter">Packagist</a>.</p>
<p><strong>This is a change from the versioning policy previously listed in the
CHANGELOG.md file.</strong>  It previously stated that removing support for a PHP
version would be a major release.  However, this is not how the wider PHP
ecosystem treats it, and it does not appear to be <em>necessary</em> under Semantic
Versioning.  In particular, this package has no user-facing API, and
therefore, nothing is broken by this change.</p>
<p>Since release, I have found that the 1.0 branch's support of PHP 7.1 is overly
broad.  By the time my package is useful (Slim 4.9.0), Slim itself required
PHP 7.3.  Nevertheless, v1.0.2 keeps <strong>all</strong> support that v1.0.0 promised.</p>

presumably, all previous versions.  I will be testing the non-updated version
of Pale Moon included with Fossapup64 9.5, and making any additional updates
that prove to be necessary.</p>
<p>I have also learned that Quilt Draw <em>does not</em> work in Windows XP, due to my
choice of color picker library.  No changes are expected in that situation, but
it would have been cool if it had worked.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-am-i-doing-this">
<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p>Accessibility is important.</p>
<p>I have <em>used</em> Pale Moon, and I understand it has a ton of shortcomings for the
self-styled &quot;modern&quot; Web.  But that makes it doubly important: clearly, the
people who are <em>using</em> Pale Moon, <strong>need it.</strong></p>
<p>(To look at the situation from another angle, this is the logical extension of
when I would write for &quot;the version of the programming language that shipped in
Debian Stable.&quot; I do not wish to unreasonably stifle users.)</p>
<p>Can we truly say that we &quot;value&quot; something, if we have never made the slightest
sacrifice for it?</p>

<h2>What’s new?</h2>
<p>A native dark theme has been added.  If the browser reports that the page
should be rendered in dark mode, then an updated theme will be applied.</p>
<p>A “Flip” tool has been added.  Left-click (primary click) will flip a square
horizontally, and right-click (secondary click) will flip it vertically.  This
complements the “Spin” tool, because some multi-color designs are asymmetric
and can’t be spun into all configurations.</p>
<p>Finally, an option for guides to be added to the block editor is available, to
help visualize the individual square boundaries.  If the guides are active on
the page, then the download will also include them.</p>

<h2>What is quilt-draw?</h2>
<p>Quilt Draw is a quarter-square triangle designing tool.  It lets you pick a
set of colors, then modify a single quilt block using them. A preview of a
full quilt using the block is generated in real time.  There are also options
for adding borders and sashing to the preview.</p>

preview.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-devproxy2">
<h2>What is devproxy2?</h2>
<p>devproxy2 is an HTTP/HTTPS proxy server that redirects configured
domains to an arbitrary destination.  This allows a Web browser to use a
production URL to access a development VM/container.</p>
<p>In combination with an extension like <a class="reference external" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/proxy-switcher-and-manager/">Proxy Switcher and Manager</a>,
choosing production or development is fast and simple, and has a
graphical status indication.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use NAT port forwarding (e.g. port 8080 on the
host to port 80 on the VM) to access the development code, without the
development code needing to know that the browser sees it on a
nonstandard port.  That information is held only in the proxy and
forwarding configurations.</p>

<div class="section" id="release-details">
<h2>Release Details</h2>
<p>Since the 2.1.0 release, the following changes have been made:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The security posture has been improved, per <a class="reference external" href="https://www.elttam.com/blog/golang-codereview/">advice</a> that was posted
on r/netsec.</li>
<li>The default ports for servers are applied correctly; this feature was
broken in 2.1.0 with the switch to go-toml 2.x.</li>
<li>The author is using Podman for testing instead of Docker.</li>
<li>Dependencies have been updated.</li>
</ol>

            <p>A new <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">quilt-draw</span></tt> release has been made!  This may also be the world’s
first announcement of its existence, outside of appearing in a GitHub
repository.</p>
<p>To use it, go to its <a class="reference external" href="https://sapphirecat.github.io/quilt-draw/">repository page</a>.  <strong>Known issue:</strong> Dark Reader
completely destroys the UI elements.  Please turn off Dark Reader for the
site.</p>

<h2>What is quilt-draw?</h2>
<p>Quilt Draw is a quarter-square triangle designing tool.  It lets you pick a
set of colors, then modify a single quilt block using them. A preview of a
full quilt using the block is generated in real time.  There are also options
for adding borders and sashing to the preview.</p>
<p>Finally, there are options to download both the block itself, and the quilt
preview.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-new">
<h2>What is new?</h2>
<p>When the width of the window exceeded 1600 pixels, there were coordinate
errors.  They are now fixed.  It’s a hack, but it works.</p>
<p>I have also updated the components (the color picker) to the latest version.
The main code still targets ES6/2015, so there should be few issues, even on
older computers.</p>
